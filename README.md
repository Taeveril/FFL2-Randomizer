# Final Fantasy Legend 2 Randomizer
Version 0.1.0 (5/21/2025):
==========================
- Initial commit that shuffles treasures and MAGI.

How to:
- Download the Python scripts (and install Python if you don't have it).
- Will prompt for a GB ROM and seed.
- Will shuffle treasures and MAGI and output a ROM of its own.

Plans:
- There's more in the works, but this is just the initial version for the time being.

Credits and thank yous:
This project really stands on the shoulders of giants. Over two decades of people poking and
mapping the ROM have made this possible.
