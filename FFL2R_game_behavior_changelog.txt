FFLegend 2 Randomizer Game Behavior Changelog:
Last updated - 01/11/2026

Game behavior here is defined as player expectation from previously playing Final Fantasy Legend 2. Due to the nature of wanting to accomplish 
various goals in the randomizer, altering game behavior becomes forced. However, most of the game behavior has been retained as much as possible, 
and often times players might not be aware of the changes. The purpose of this txt file is to chronicle those changes.

- Memo menu removed. Memo calls that prompt dialogue have remained, but most instances of memo-flag setting have been removed from scripting,
  freeing up a not-insignificant number of bytes.
  
- Advancing to the next world used to use magi-count-checks calls to grant access. This has changed to be event-based instead, save for the pillar to
  Final World.
  
- Ki's shrine only has four NPCs + Ki. This is due to a maximum of six unique NPC sprites on a map, one of which got repurposed to a guardian 
  helper to let players back into Ki's body. The dialogue text script has been removed and freed up bytes.
  
- Venus' world for some reason relied heavily on using magi-count-checks rather than var states. In fixing this, the player no longer requires to 
  talk to Leon to be let into the sewer. It's a bit of a non-sequitor. Instead the NPC sewer block has a varstate check of 8,0,0 and dialogue 
  options altered to properly check for var states.
  
- Ashura, Venus, and Odin all reused a script that dropped one of each elemental+stat magi. The randomizer gives Ashura and Venus their own, which
  mimics the drops if magi is unshuffled.
 
- The dragon race as a whole has been rescripted. It no longer relies on doubling up on var usage tied to Ki's body, as well as fixing other bugs,
  like teleporting out while mounted.

- Due to how world randomization can happen, the Dad death cutscene will now automatically play and at the end put you back at the Ninja World
  pillar.
  
- Giant's World had a magi-count-check on one of the houses to make sure players grab the magi before the micron. This has been removed
  whole.

- The dragon race now uses the fake dad variable in the first town. It's possible to never see the cutscene if you never enter the first town,
  beat the race, and then enter the first town for the first time.

- Empty treasure chests are now NPCs, with the treasure chest flags being freed up for other purposes. The knockon effect is they stay around after
  triggering them.
  
- TrueEye Magi doesn't do anything, but it is a magi. Normally sets a variable (5) to allow the player to enter the Cave of Light. Now it uses
  a proper treasure chest, and the script checks to see if the TrueEye Magi is in the player's possession. This winds up fixing a logical error 
  where the Cave of Light remains visible even though Apollo steals the magi.

- Giant's World var usage has been extended to include Dad (some reason uses Ashura's world var) and all the way through Ki's body.
  
- Ki's body now reuses some Final World variables, but resets them to 0 upon completion.

- Apollo's world has been rescripted to be more randomizer friendly. To be able to move onto the next world, you must defeat Dunatis and exit
  through the Cave of Light.
  
- As of ver 2.0 the Celesial Palace shaking currently does not work, probably due to an effort to free up var 29. This may be fixed eventually,
  but it is considered extremely low priority.
