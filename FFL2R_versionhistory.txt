Final Fantasy Legend 2 Randomizer Version History

Version 0.9.0 (12/14/2025):
	World Shuffle is in.
		You still need 76 Magi to get access to Final World, still the right pillar in Valhalla.
		Prism use will give inaccurate counts. Should be fixed by next update.
		Teleport unlocks will be inconsistent. Should be fixed by next update.

Version 0.8.2 (11/5/2025):
	Most of the inner re-scripting has been completed. The next phase is world rando.
	Dismounting from your dragon is now done in assembly code.

Version 0.8.1 (10/2/2025):
	Char2's parent at the starting town will now give you a random item instead of just a cure potion.
	More behind-the-scenes work that isn't player facing.

Version 0.8.0 (9/17/2025):
	Added NPCs will now let you access things previously closed off:
		After Ki leaves, an NPC next to the first world central pillar will let you revisit Ashura's Base.
		An NPC will sell Echigoya's wares after he abandons his conuter.
		An NPC will let you teleport back into Ki's body after rescuing her.
	A lot of not-player-facing stuff is being reworked to better work future endeavors.
		
Version 0.7.3 (8/27/2025):
	The Race has been reworked:
		If you teleport/door out during the race, you will now be dismounted.
			The dragon will remain on the track when you return.
			It is not encouraged to switch mounts while racing, or you could end up with off-magi counts or other weirdness.
		When returning, dragon availability will depend on which magi have been acquired.
		Fixed the graphical issue introduced with the movement speed boost.

Version 0.7.2 (8/9/2025):
	Some more quality of life bugfixing  (thank you tehtmi!):
		Gold will now calculate correctly when multiple groups of enemies are defeated and meat/an item drops.
		Multiple stats can grow after battle for a single character.
			The chance to grow has also drastically increased.
			The chance for mutants to change skills has also slightly increased.
	Will now check for a correct rom.

	Randomized monsters in the starting character select screen. Will also show hidden DS level to give players an idea of how good they are at the start.
