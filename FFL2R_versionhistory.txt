Final Fantasy Legend 2 Randomizer Version History

Version 0.6.0 (6/23/2025):

	Randomized monsters in the starting character select screen. Will also show hidden DS level to give players an idea of how good they are at the start.
	Text speed will default to fastest, pressing a button unnecessary.
	Fixed an issue where encounter rate adjustment would create a game-fatal treasure chest in the Nasty Dungeon if interacted with.

Version 0.5.1 (6/23/2025):

	Movement speed is doubled.

Version 0.5.0 (6/21/2025):

        Gold drops will currently cap at 65535. 10% bonus for all monsters defeated still there.
        Have not yet fixed the meat/gold drop bug. Learning assembly (and translating it to hex) as fast as I can to try and get this fixed.

    Fixed an issue where the title screen may not always show the seed number.
